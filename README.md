## My Process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

- Mobile first workflow

### What I learned

In this challenge, I learned how to create overlays with icons on images and practiced customizing link colors using pseudo-classes for hover, focus and inactive states. 

### Continued development

I will continue my efforts to improve my skills in creating responsive CSS styles and strengthen my abilities in precise element positioning.
